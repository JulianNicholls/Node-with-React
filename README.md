# Node-with-React
Code from the Node with React: Full-stack Web Development course by Stephen Grider at https://www.udemy.com/node-with-react-fullstack-web-development/learn/v4/content

## Progress

Working on Section 8 - Handling Payments

## Differences from Stephen

* I will be checking in my code to git and Github much more often than 
Stephen does. Later on, I will probably deploy to Heroku more often too.

* I am saving the display name for a user along with the Google ID and 
displaying it in the header.

## Git client

I have used Git at the command-line for 10 years.
Over that time, I have tried many different graphical shells for Git,
without finding one that was easier and nicer to use than the command-line
(in my view).

I have now found that [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) is an excellent
Git shell and would advise using it to everyone.
