# React-2-Expensify
Expensify App from the second half of [The Complete React Web Developer Course 
(2nd Edition) by Andrew Mead](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/learn/v4/content)

## Progress

Working on section 17 - Styling

## Differences from Andrew

### I'm using the latest version of all the NPM modules. 

This has caused a cascade of changes...

Because the latest webpack-dev-server requires Webpack 4, I am using that version, which has
some differences from previous versions. 

Extract-text-webpack-plugin is actually a beta of the next version
because the currently released version does not work with Webpack 4.

### I haven't done the Portfolio app, destructuring, HOC, or some of the redux examples.

### There is some minimal CSS until the app is finally styled in section 17.

## Git client

I have used Git at the command-line for 10 years.
Over that time, I have tried many different graphical shells for Git,
without finding one that was easier and nicer to use than the command-line
(in my view).

I have now found that [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) is an excellent
Git shell and would advise using it to everyone.
